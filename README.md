# android-api-trace
building a tool to trace api calls in an android app also learning go at the same time

## Plans:
-- read file, export to json or txt  
-- only accept APK files  
-- Filter unwanted data from apk .dex, resource folders, images  
-- get a list of API calls, probably will have to scrape android developer docs for API's
